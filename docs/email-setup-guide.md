# Email Setup Guide - User Approval System

## üìç Where to Set Email Credentials

- The email address and app password are set in the file:
  `/var/www/storage-app-server/.env.remote`
- Update these lines to change the sender or password:
  ```env
  EMAIL_USER=antonio.guiotto.dev@gmail.com
  EMAIL_PASS=jawz dlnw bzvp kczq
  ```
- **After any change, always restart the server:**
  ```bash
  pm2 restart storage-app-server
  ```

This guide explains how to configure email notifications for the user approval system.

Add these to `/var/www/storage-app-server/.env.remote`:

```env
# Email Configuration

EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

## üöÄ After Configuration

1. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www
   pm2 restart storage-app-server
   ```

2. **Test the system:**
   - Register a new user at `http://termoparotto.micro-cloud.it/register`
   - Check if admin receives notification email
   - Approve user and check if user receives approval email

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Check your app password is correct
- **"Authentication failed"**: Ensure 2FA is enabled for Gmail
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check firewall/network settings
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Free providers have daily limits

### Test Email Connection:
```bash
# Check server logs for email errors
pm2 logs storage-app-server
```

## üìã What the System Does

1. **User Registration**: Sends notification email to admin
2. **User Approval**: Sends confirmation email to approved user
3. **User Rejection**: Sends rejection email to user (with optional reason)

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.remote` to version control
- App passwords are more secure than regular passwords
- Each provider has different security requirements
- Consider using environment-specific email accounts
